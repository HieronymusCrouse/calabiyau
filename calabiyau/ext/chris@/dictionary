# This file contains dictionary translations for parsing
# requests and generating responses.  All transactions are
# composed of Attribute/Value Pairs.  The value of each attribute
# is specified as one of a few data types.  Valid data types are:
#
# string     - printable text, generally UTF-8 encoded.  (The RFCs call this "text")
# ipaddr     - 4 octets in network byte order
# ipv4prefix - 1 octet reserved, one octet prefix, 4 octets ipaddr
# integer    - 32 bit value in big endian order
# integer64  - 64 bit value in big endian order
# date       - 32 bit value in big endian order - seconds since
#              00:00:00 GMT,  Jan.  1,  1970
# ifid       - 8 octets in network byte order
# ipv6addr   - 16 octets in network byte order
# ipv6prefix - 1 octet reserved, one octet prefix, 16 octets ipv6addr
# tlv    - type-length-value
#
# FreeRADIUS includes data types which are not defined
# in the RFC's.  These data types are:
#
# abinary - Ascend's binary filter format.
# byte    - 8 bit unsigned integer
# ether   - 6 octets of hh:hh:hh:hh:hh:hh
#           where 'h' is hex digits, upper or lowercase.
# short   - 16-bit unsigned integer in network byte order
# signed  - 32-bit signed integer in network byte order
# octets  - raw octets, printed and input as hex strings.
#           e.g.: 0x123456789abcdef  The RFCs call this "string".
